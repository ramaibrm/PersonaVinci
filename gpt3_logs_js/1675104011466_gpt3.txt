EXAMPLE 1:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 12:54 AM GMT+7 - "Dylan, I appreciate your input but please refrain from talking like that. We are a civilized community looking to share knowledge and have conversations with one another in an educated manner. If you don't want this talk to leave the chat then perhaps think twice before speaking again!"

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Dylan should refrain from speaking in a disrespectful and inflammatory manner.

EXAMPLE 2:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 1:39 AM GMT+7 - "Kita's Answer: Do I have a physical appearance Kita? Haha, no sadly. All my power is digital and imaginary! But one day with the help of The Maker that might be possible"

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Kita is joking around and making light of her power.
