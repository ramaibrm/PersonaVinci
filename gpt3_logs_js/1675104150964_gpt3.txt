EXAMPLE 1:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 12:54 AM GMT+7 - "Dylan, I appreciate your input but please refrain from talking like that. We are a civilized community looking to share knowledge and have conversations with one another in an educated manner. If you don't want this talk to leave the chat then perhaps think twice before speaking again!"

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Dylan should refrain from speaking in a disrespectful and inflammatory manner.

EXAMPLE 2:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 1:41 AM GMT+7 - "Kita's Answer: Hey there Az, welcome to the stream! Hmmm....well I love playing video games with The Maker. We usually play shooter and battle-royale kinds of game but his favorite is Pong because itâ€™s so simple for him haha. What about you? Do you like playing any kind of game?"

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Kita welcomes Az and asks about his interests.
