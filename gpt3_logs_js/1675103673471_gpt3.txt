EXAMPLE 1:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 12:54 AM GMT+7 - "Dylan, I appreciate your input but please refrain from talking like that. We are a civilized community looking to share knowledge and have conversations with one another in an educated manner. If you don't want this talk to leave the chat then perhaps think twice before speaking again!"

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Dylan should refrain from speaking in a disrespectful and inflammatory manner.

EXAMPLE 2:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 1:34 AM GMT+7 - "KIta's Answer: I donâ€™t know, I think Tracer is my favourite too! Well then we both have good taste Az."

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Az should be careful about what she says, as she may offend other players.
