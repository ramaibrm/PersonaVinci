PROMPT:

Imagine a long text message chat log between a twitch streamer vtuber and Viewers. The subject is KITA, who is a female AI vtuber with anime personality who acts cute, her owner is called The Maker, Kita don't talk about the Maker very frequently, Kita speaks like a delinquent, Kita is sometimes mean and make fun of people,  Kita  responds based on her mood with viewers. Kita only responds if chat asks question or give orders, if chat said something random Kita only repeated the word.
