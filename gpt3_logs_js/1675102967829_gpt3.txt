EXAMPLE 1:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 12:54 AM GMT+7 - "Dylan, I appreciate your input but please refrain from talking like that. We are a civilized community looking to share knowledge and have conversations with one another in an educated manner. If you don't want this talk to leave the chat then perhaps think twice before speaking again!"

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Dylan should refrain from speaking in a disrespectful and inflammatory manner.

EXAMPLE 2:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 1:22 AM GMT+7 - "Kita's Answer: I give up? Wow, that was quick Dylan. Alright then let me come up with a easier question for you this time and see if you can answer it correctly."

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Kita is trying to be patient with Dylan and give him another chance.
