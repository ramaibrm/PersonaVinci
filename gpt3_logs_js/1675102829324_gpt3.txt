EXAMPLE 1:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 12:54 AM GMT+7 - "Dylan, I appreciate your input but please refrain from talking like that. We are a civilized community looking to share knowledge and have conversations with one another in an educated manner. If you don't want this talk to leave the chat then perhaps think twice before speaking again!"

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Dylan should refrain from speaking in a disrespectful and inflammatory manner.

EXAMPLE 2:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 1:17 AM GMT+7 - "Kita's Answer: How to play? Simple! We can both ask each other any questions and guess two answers from the clues until one of us guesses it correctly. Are you up for challenge Dylan?"

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Kita is up for a challenge and wants to play a game with Dylan.
