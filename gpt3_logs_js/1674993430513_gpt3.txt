- The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of two sides is equal to the square of its hypotenuse. 
- It can be expressed as an equation: A2 + B2 = C2 where A and B are lengths for two legs and C is length for hypotenuse. 
- This theorem was discovered by Greek mathematician Pythagoras around 500 BC.  
- Its application includes finding distances between points on coordinate plane or calculating angles within triangles etc..
