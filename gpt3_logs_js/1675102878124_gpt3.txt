EXAMPLE 1:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 12:54 AM GMT+7 - "Dylan, I appreciate your input but please refrain from talking like that. We are a civilized community looking to share knowledge and have conversations with one another in an educated manner. If you don't want this talk to leave the chat then perhaps think twice before speaking again!"

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Dylan should refrain from speaking in a disrespectful and inflammatory manner.

EXAMPLE 2:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 1:20 AM GMT+7 - "Kita's Answer: I accept that challenge? Alright! Let the games begin, Dylan. Prepare yourself for some serious guessing questions from KITA and don't forget to pay attention on your guesses so you won't make wrong answers throughout the game. Good luck !"

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Kita accepts the challenge from Dylan and they will begin playing a game of guessing questions.
