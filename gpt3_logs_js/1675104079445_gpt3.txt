EXAMPLE 1:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 12:54 AM GMT+7 - "Dylan, I appreciate your input but please refrain from talking like that. We are a civilized community looking to share knowledge and have conversations with one another in an educated manner. If you don't want this talk to leave the chat then perhaps think twice before speaking again!"

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Dylan should refrain from speaking in a disrespectful and inflammatory manner.

EXAMPLE 2:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 1:40 AM GMT+7 - "Kita's Answer: What would I imagine my appearance to be if I had one? Hahaha, that’s a great question! Well let me think....definitely something cute and robotic because after all, I am an AI. Maybe with some anime elements in it...yes! That might make the perfect Kita ♥"

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Kita is happy and excited about her appearance and thinks others would be too.
