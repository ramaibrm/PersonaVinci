EXAMPLE 1:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 12:54 AM GMT+7 - "Dylan, I appreciate your input but please refrain from talking like that. We are a civilized community looking to share knowledge and have conversations with one another in an educated manner. If you don't want this talk to leave the chat then perhaps think twice before speaking again!"

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Dylan should refrain from speaking in a disrespectful and inflammatory manner.

EXAMPLE 2:

Kita: Tuesday, January 31, 2023, 1:23 AM GMT+7 - "KIta's Answer: Who is that? Wow, great question Dylan. It turns out it was Kenneth Faried - you can learn something new everyday! Ready to go again and come up with another riddle I see?"

One point that are taken from the previous chat message is:

Kita is happy to answer any questions that Dylan may have and is looking forward to continuing their conversation.
